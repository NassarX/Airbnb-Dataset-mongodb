Through a quirk of geography, Star, Sun, Moon and St Francis streets have become an island of tranquility in a congested city. Even as the high-rises encroach, the neighbourhood\\'s dead-end streets, narrow alleyways and leafy squares retain their quietude, a quality complemented by an eclectic range of businesses that see the area\\'s calm as an asset. \"All of this makes the neighbourhood very precious,\" says architect Christopher Law.',\n 'notes': '',\n 'transit': 'Subway.

Multiple air conditioners helped keep us cool while at the apartment, and windows on three sides allowed for a nice breeze to pass through.

We especially appreciated the comfortable sofa, dining table, cosy bed, fridge, drawer space, and fast wifi. Communication with hosts was good. I'd stay here again and highly recommend it. \\n\\nThings to be aware of: \\n- It's up a hill then 4 flights of stairs. \\n- there is one wash basin shared between the bathroom and kitchen. \\n- the shower room contains the toilet so it can be a bit wet to use the toilet (and the frosted glass door doesn't give 100% privacy between the toilet and living room). \\n- there are only net curtains so you will likely want to wear sleep masks as it won't be dark. They were provided. \"},\n  {'_id': '149182197',\n   'date': datetime.datetime(2017, 5, 2, 4, 0),\n   'listing_id': '16100663',\n   'reviewer_id': '78588011',\n   'reviewer_name': 'Mai Thy',\n   'comments': \"We had a great time at Ignacio's place.

Wanchai is close to where I worked. But the best was the friendliness and energy of the host who greeted me. I felt it was personal and felt really at home. Everything was explained during the mini tour and everything is in place in the house. Not the fault of the hosts or the house but ask for more details on how to use the heater for the shower.

The apartment is is very functional, with everything you need. The location is absolutely outstanding, with hip restaurants, cafes, bars, shops, and the downtown just minutes away. It's easy to get a cab within 100 meters of the building. I felt like I was living in Hong Kong; much better than if I were staying in a hotel. I was able to do laundry, there was an iron and ironing board, hangers galore, a good table to work on, a TV I could connect use as a monitor with my HDMI cable, and very importantly, a comfortable bed. The Wi-Fi worked continuously the whole time I was there. I definitely had a good time and I would stay at Ignacio's place again if I visit Hong Kong in the future.\"},\n  {'_id': '409908671',\n   'date': datetime.datetime(2019, 2, 9, 5, 0),\n   'listing_id': '16100663',\n   'reviewer_id': '39867269',\n   'reviewer_name': 'Craig',\n   'comments': \"We really enjoyed our stay here. Ignacio was very communicative and check in was easy. The location is fantastic; the area has lots of charm and there is easy access to the metro. The apartment is small (but probably bigger by Hong Kong standards) but offered everything we needed. Bed was comfortable, kitchenette was handy, and the washing machine was useful. Note that the shower is located right beside the toilet in the same little room, and the only sink is in the kitchen, which might be odd for some westerners like us, but it's probably  normal for Hong Kong and we got used to it. The sheer bedroom curtains don't block out any city lights; we slept well regardless, but bring an eye mask if you're sensitive to light at night. Overall it was a positive experience and we would stay here again!\"},\n  {'_id': '412189725',\n   'date': datetime.datetime(2019, 2, 15, 5, 0),\n   'listing_id': '16100663',\n   'reviewer_id': '70417541',\n   'reviewer_name': 'ÂÆù',\n   'comments': 'ÊàøÂ≠êÂú®‰∏≠ÁéØËøô‰∏™‰ΩçÁΩÆÂ∑≤ÁªèÁÆóÊòØÂæà‰∏çÈîôÁöÑ‰∫Ü,Á¶ªÂïÜÂú∫ÔΩ§ÂêÉÈ•≠ÁöÑÂú∞ÊñπËµ∞Ë∑ØÂ§ßÊ¶Ç‰∫îÂàÜÈíü,Á¶ªÂú∞ÈìÅÁ´ôÂ§ßÁ∫¶‰∫îÂàÜÈíüÊ≠•Ë°åÔΩ°ÊàøÈó¥Âú®‰∫îÊ•º,Êó†ÁîµÊ¢ØÔΩ°\\nÊàø‰∏úË∂ÖÁ∫ßÁÉ≠ÊÉÖÂ•ΩÂÆ¢,ËÄå‰∏îÂØπ‰∫∫‰πüÂæàÂ•Ω,ÂæàniceÁöÑÊàø‰∏ú,‰∏ãÊ¨°ÂÜçÊù•È¶ôÊ∏ØÂ∏åÊúõÊúâÊú∫‰ºöËÉΩÂÜçËÆ¢Âà∞ËøôÈó¥Êàø'},\n  {'_id': '413753630',\n   'date': datetime.datetime(2019, 2, 18, 5, 0),\n   'listing_id': '16100663',\n   'reviewer_id': '4387415',\n   'reviewer_name': 'Sue',\n   'comments': 'What else can I say that has not been said before. This experience has been slightly different fr my other AirBnB in HK (am here 1-3x a yr). First off, Ignacio met me at Pacific Place and showed me ard the studio. Next up, the water heater works and there was hot water throughout (a few times,  hot water stays for 5min). Lastly, this is only the second place which has a portable heater even though I didn‚Äôt need it coz the temps were mild.

Surround by many trendy & delicious restaurants & cafes its a great place to base yourself for adventuring around Hong Kong. It‚Äôs close to Central station, which means you can get everywhere super fast. The apartment itself is cosy for 2 (yes small but actually feels like I‚Äôm in Europe rather than Hong Kong).\\nAlthough there is no elevator, the host was kind enough to meet me at the station and help me carry the case up the stairs. Also flexible on arranging time to meet & provided good notes on how to get there. As a solo traveller I felt safe walking around the area at night. Really enjoyed staying for 4 nights and I would definitely stay here again, was nice to feel like a home away from home.'},\n  {'_id': '417365012',\n   'date': datetime.datetime(2019, 2, 27, 5, 0),\n   'listing_id': '16100663',\n   'reviewer_id': '51120293',\n   'reviewer_name': 'Juliette',\n   'comments': 'Very nice apartment well located in the center of Hong-Kong. It s near shops, restaurants and the subway which is very convenient. However you should be aware that it is super small meaning you ll have to shower right above the toilets and there is only one sink for both brushing your teeths and doing the dishes. Also, there are no shades in the bedroom so you ll be waken up by the sun quite early. And last thing there are some construction work right in front of the building so it s extremely noisy during the day (as of February 25th they were just making the foundation of the building so it might be a while..). Overall not such a great experience although Ignacio was extremely nice and the apartment is charming !

welcoming and supportive. They provided all useful details on the area and offered all their help. \\nThe apartment was extremely clean and decorated with all details. Very cozy and comfy only a few flights of stairs from the trendy area but at the same time a quiet place with plenty of natural light that made us feel at home. Amazingly quiet for such a great location close to so many attractions.\\nA wide variety of nice restaurants right down the building. So many delicious options for breakfast, lunch and dinner I wish we had more days to try them all out!!\\nToo bad we could only stay for one night this time. Definitely planing to book this place again when back in HK‚Ä¶.and hopefully for a longer stay :-)\\nThanks Veronica and Ignacio, hope to see you again soon'},\n  {'_id': '117107675',\n   'schema_version': 2,\n   'date': datetime.datetime(2016, 12, 4, 5, 0),\n   'listing_id': '16100663',\n   'reviewer_id': '17140300',\n   'reviewer_name': 'Kevin',\n   'comments': \"Had an absolutely wonderful stay at this place.

    "The most typical use case for the database is to show information relating to a property listing to a customer. This is done by a query to the database which returns one of the listing documents. Currently a lot of time is spent when a listing is retrieved from the database to show to a customer. Decide what information should be returned in a typical query and optimise the structure for this use case. For example, we typically only want a sample of reviews but not all reviews (although all reviews ), the customer does not need to know past transaction data, etc. Update the document schema for this typical use case. This may involve the creation of new collections and documents."

Through a quirk of geography, Star, Sun, Moon and St Francis streets have become an island of tranquility in a congested city. Even as the high-rises encroach, the neighbourhood\\'s dead-end streets, narrow alleyways and leafy squares retain their quietude, a quality complemented by an eclectic range of businesses that see the area\\'s calm as an asset. \"All of this makes the neighbourhood very precious,\" says architect Christopher Law.',\n 'notes': '',\n 'transit': 'Subway.
